Hello! Welcome to my page. My name is Sidharth Babu, and I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm passionate about intelligent and performant software engineering, applied data science, intelligent edge devices, and pretty much anything else that manages to spark my curiosity. 

As part of my campus community, I'm a part of the Longhorn Racing Solar team, where we build a Solar-Powered Racecar from scratch. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.longhornracing.org/solar-vehicle)!

Work in Progress.
