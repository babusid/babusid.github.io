# Welcome to my blog!
Here's where  I post recipes that I try day to day, side projects and tutorials, as well as the occasional musing as to the state of the world. I try to write blog posts as often as I can, and they're sorted by recency within their categories. Below, you can see the most recent two posts within each category, or you can click on a category title to see all the posts within!
