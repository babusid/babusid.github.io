# Hello!
<span class="image left"><span class="image fit"><img src="{{ "/images/DSC_0376.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span></span>
Welcome to my website! My name is Sidharth Babu, and I'm a college student studying at the University of Texas at Austin!
I'm studying Computer Engineering, as I love both software and hardware, and I dream of becoming an entrepreneur! 
In my free time, I love to cook, work out, do side projects with computers, and spend time with my friends. Here on my site you can find
my resum√© and I plan to add a personal blog soon! You can also directly connect with me through the form at the bottom of this page, or through my social media! 
I look forward to connecting with you!
